### 💡 Core Chat Functionality

* **Anonymous Usernames**: Users can join the chat by providing a simple username. The server tracks each user with a unique ID based on their socket connection.
* **Real-time Messaging**: Messages are sent and received in real-time, instantly appearing in the chatroom for all participants.
* **Multiple Chatrooms**: The application supports multiple chatrooms, starting with three default rooms (`General`, `Random`, `Tech`). Users can also create their own new rooms dynamically.
* **Message History**: Messages are stored on the server, and the chat history for a room is automatically loaded when a user joins or switches to that room.
* **User and Room Synchronization**: The list of online users and available rooms is synced across all clients. When a user joins or leaves a room, the user count is updated in real-time.

### 🎨 User Interface & Experience

TalkAnon provides a visually rich and responsive user interface:

* **Responsive Design**: The entire layout is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
* **Modern and Clean UI**: The application features a clean, card-based design with smooth animations and a consistent color palette.
* **Modal-based Workflow**: Key interactions like logging in, creating rooms, and accessing settings are handled via unobtrusive modals.
* **User Notifications**: The application provides toast notifications for key events like successful login, connection errors, and room creation.
* **Automatic Scrolling**: The message area automatically scrolls to the bottom when new messages are added, ensuring users always see the latest content.

### ⭐ Stand-out Features

* **Comprehensive Message Formatting**: The chat supports a variety of text formatting options, including:
    * **Bold text**: Using `**text**`.
    * **Italic text**: Using `*text*`.
    * **Links**: Automatically converts URLs into clickable links.
    * **Code Blocks**: Supports both inline code using `` `code` `` and multi-line code blocks using ` ```code``` `.
* **Customizable Settings**: Users can personalize their experience through a settings menu, which includes a dark mode toggle, notification sound toggle, and timestamp toggle.
* **Emoji Support**: An emoji picker allows users to easily insert emojis into their messages.
